# UrBusWeb

Every week there are accidents caused by public transport, 3-4 accidents a day. 

Police have tried many times to control this situation, but not to succeed.

We developed a tool to help police monitor more efficiently speed limits, maneuvers and sudden braking, it is a web application where the entity traffic can see every movement of public transport and receive alerts when on passing the limits of speed, so that they may decide to do with drivers who do not respect the law.

Transit may also know when a bus makes stops clandestine, as these generate traffic stops. 

With the data obtained, also developed a mobile application for the general public, users will be able to know the nearby routes and the approximate time to reach the bus stop, so we avoid the congestion of people in the bus stops to reduce round the bus stop.
